improve_adaptive_annealing
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Add an adaptive temperature schedule that adjusts based on recent improvement trends during the annealing process, coupled with a final local greedy refinement. This aims to better balance exploration and exploitation, helping the algorithm escape local minima and achieve higher total radii sum.
