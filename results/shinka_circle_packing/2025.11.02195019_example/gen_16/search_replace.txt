<DESCRIPTION>
Enhance the compute_max_radii function by iteratively refining the radii to maximize them while maintaining non-overlap and boundary constraints. Instead of a single pass scaling, perform multiple sweeps until radii converge, which better approximates the maximal packing radii. This approach leverages insight #5 and #7, ensuring the radii are as large as possible given the centers, improving the sum of radii.
